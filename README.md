**real time computer vision–based robotic arm control system** -> **hand gesture recognition** -> **4-DOF robot arm** .
The system integrates **MediaPipe (Python)** for perception and **Arduino** for hardware control through a **robust serial communication pipeline** with proper state handling.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Perception → Decision → Control** pipeline:

* Webcam captures hand gestures
* MediaPipe detects and stabilizes finger count
* Python logic decides valid actions
* Commands are sent to Arduino via Serial
* Arduino executes motion while maintaining busy/idle state

The robot **ignores noisy or repeated inputs** and only accepts new commands after completing the current task.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Real-time hand detection using **MediaPipe**
* Stable finger counting with temporal smoothing
* Odd / even gesture-based control logic
* Serial communication with **task acknowledgment**
* Robot **busy / idle state handling** (debouncing)
* Modular Python + Arduino architecture
* Designed for **hardware reliability**, not just demo behavior

## ▶️ How It Works (Brief)

* **Finger count = 0** → system idle, ready for next command
* **Finger count ≠ 0** → command evaluated (odd / even)
* Robot executes **one action at a time**
* Further gestures are ignored until Arduino reports completion

This prevents accidental retriggering and unsafe motion.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Arduino

* Open Arduino IDE
* Upload code from `Arduino_Code/` to the board
* Keep Serial Monitor closed (or baud-matched)

### 2️⃣ Python

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python pyserial
python mediapipe_serial_trigger.py
```

* Ensure the correct **COM port** is set (or auto-detected)

---

## 🎯 Applications

* Human–Robot Interaction (HRI)
* Assistive robotics
* Vision-based control systems
* Robotics + AI academic projects
* Embedded systems with perception

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Gesture classification using ML models
* ROS / ROS2 integration
* Depth camera support
* Continuous pose-based control
* Feedback via encoders or sensors

## 📌 Notes for Reviewers

This project emphasizes **system reliability**, **state management**, and **real hardware integration**, going beyond simple gesture demos.
